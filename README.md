## Overview
This project contains code to simulate the planets in the solar system up until Neptune using an N-body implementation. The code is used to simulate a black hole approaching our solar system and measuring the number of planets that escape the orbit of the sun in such a situation.

## Running the code
By executing run_full.sh (using 'bash' not 'sh') multiple simulations will be run to ultimately produce a heatmap of the results. Intermediate results will be stored in the output directory (and the final figure will also be saved here in the directory 'figs').
### Note
Running the file as is will run a test version, results will not completely match with those in the reports, but it will run in five minutes in stead of 3 hours.
